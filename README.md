This project is based on my interpretation of Kandinskyâ€™s Composition VIII.

It involves moving rectangles, ellipses, lines, points, and triangles.
I tried to keep the shapes within the frame by having them bounce when they touched the frame.

To interact:
- Press a or A to stop and align all shapes' velocity/motion
- Click on the mouse to randomize all the shapes' sizes and positions
- The shapes will follow your mouse when it moves
