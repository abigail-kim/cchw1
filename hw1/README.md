Overview: 
This project is based on my interpretation of Kandinskyâ€™s Composition VIII. When I first saw this painting, it felt very chaotic. But I soon learned that Kandinsky was trying to create movement and emotional responses through chaos and order, through his use of geometric shapes and colors.

My Focus:
I tried to incorporate many different shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, points, and triangles. Since Kandinsky was trying to create movement through his painting, I tried to include movement and motion by having the shapes bounce off the frame, without ever going outside of the frame. In terms of colors, I tried to make it very colorful because I noticed Kandinsky used many different colors in his painting.


To Interact:
- Press a or A to stop and align all shapes' velocity/motion
- Click on the mouse to randomize all the shapes' sizes and positions
- Move your mouse for the shapes to follow it around
